# Pagination Demonstration

NOTE: This project is a part of Treehouse's Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree Program

## What is this
This project is a demonstration of client-side list filtering and pagination. A list of students of arbitrary length is hidden on page load. The first 10 students are then unhidden. Dynamically appended "pagination" links at the bottom of the page allow the user to view subsequent pages. The user can also use a search box to search the text of the students' names and email addresses and the list displayed students will change to match.

The site is deployed here:
